 ## Exercise - Create Closures
 
 Create a closure assigned to a constant `blankClosure` that has no parameters and no return value.
 */



/*:
  Create a closure assigned to a constant `fourClosure` that has no parameters and returns an `Int`. The body of the closure should always return the value 4. Call the closure four times.
 */


/*:
 Create a closure assigned to a constant `greeting` that accepts a `name` string argument with no return value. Within the body of the closure, print the argument. Call the closure four times using "Gary", "Jane", "Rick", and "Beth" as arguments.

/*:
 ## Exercise - Passing Closures as Arguments and Syntactic Sugar
 Define a function `forward` that has two `String` arguments, `name1` and `name2`, and returns a `Bool`. Within the definition of the function, print each of the arguments, then return whether `name1` is less than `name2`. You can use comparison operators, such as `<` and `>`, to compare alphabetical order in strings.
 */


/*:
 Create a `[String]` collection using names of your friends and family. Call the collection's `sorted(by:)` function, passing in `forward` as the argument. Store the result into `sortedCollection1`, then print the result. This should sort your collection alphabetically.
 */


/*:
 Using your initial collection of unsorted friend and family names, call the collection's `sorted(by:)` function, but pass in your own closure instead of the `forward` function. The closure should sort the collection in the same way as `forward`. Be sure to include parameter names, parameter types, and the `return` statement within your closure. Store the result in `sortedCollection2`, then print the result.
 */


/*:
 Similar to the previous exercise, call the collection's `sorted(by:)` function, but remove as much of the unnecessary closure syntax as you can. Store the result in `sortedCollection3`, then print the result.

 ## Exercise - Collection Functions
 Using the code below, use the `map` function to create an array of `Int` values whose values are equal to the original integer values plus 1. Use `$0` as you iterate through the values of the array. Print the resulting collection.

 Using the code below, use the `filter` function to create a new array of `String` values. The new array should only include strings longer than four characters. Use `$0` as you iterate through the values of the array.  Print the resulting collection.

 Using the code below, use the `reduce` function to subtract all of the values within the array from a starting value of 100. Print the resulting value.
